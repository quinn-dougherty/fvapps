      "Fortunately, even though your robots have escaped, you still have some control over them. First of all, you know the location of each robot: the world you live in can be modeled as an infinite coordinate plane, and the $i$-th robot is currently located at the point having coordinates ($x_i$, $y_i$). Furthermore, you may send exactly one command to all of the robots. The command should contain two integer numbers $X$ and $Y$, and when each robot receives this command, it starts moving towards the point having coordinates ($X$, $Y$). The robot stops its movement in two cases:  either it reaches ($X$, $Y$);  or it cannot get any closer to ($X$, $Y$). \n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, all robots should be able to get from any point of the coordinate plane to any other point. Each robot usually can perform four actions to move. Let's denote the current coordinates of the robot as ($x_c$, $y_c$). Then the movement system allows it to move to any of the four adjacent points:  the first action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c - 1$, $y_c$);  the second action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c$, $y_c + 1$);  the third action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c + 1$, $y_c$);  the fourth action allows it to move from ($x_c$, $y_c$) to ($x_c$, $y_c - 1$). \n",

The first two numbers describe the initial location of the $i$-th robot, and the following four numbers describe which actions the $i$-th robot can use to move ($f_{i, j} = 1$ if the $i$-th robot can use the $j$-th action, and $f_{i, j} = 0$ if it cannot use the $j$-th action).\n",

Both $X$ and $Y$ should not exceed $10^5$ by absolute value; it is guaranteed that if there exists at least one point reachable by all robots, then at least one of such points has both coordinates not exceeding $10^5$ by absolute value.\n",
